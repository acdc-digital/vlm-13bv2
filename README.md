In this part, we will guide you through running MiniGPT-4 and testing it with sample inputs to ensure it works correctly. We will also provide additional context based on related works [6, 7, 11, 12, 29] to enhance your understanding of the model's capabilities and potential applications.

Running MiniGPT-4

Familiarize yourself with input/output options for running MiniGPT-4 by reviewing the minigpt4_eval.yaml file. This file contains various parameters that control the model's behavior during execution.

Set low_resource to False in minigpt4_eval.yaml:

Open minigpt4_eval.yaml in PyCharm.
Locate the line with "low_resource" and set its value to False.
Save and close the file.
Run the demo using the provided command:

In PyCharm Terminal, execute the following command:
python run_minigpt4.py eval_configs/minigpt4_eval.yaml
The model will start processing, and you should see output indicating its progress.
3.1. (expanded) Run a sample demo using a provided input prompt:

In PyCharm Terminal, execute the following command with a sample input prompt:
python run_minigpt4.py eval_configs/minigpt4_eval.yaml --input_prompt "Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice who lived in a small village."
The model will start processing, and you should see output indicating its progress. When it finishes, you'll see MiniGPT-4's generated continuation of the text based on the input prompt.
Testing MiniGPT-4
